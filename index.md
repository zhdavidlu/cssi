## Projects

#### High-Power Experimental Rocketry

Development of a high-power hybrid rocket started in June 2018 with the sub-scale Test Motor 1A (TM-1A). TM-1A underwent 3 series of static fires June - November 2018. Data collected from these static fires and other lessons learned informed the development a new and improved iteration, Test Motor 1B (TM-1B), which was completed in August 2019. TM-1B completed one static fire series August - September 2019, which characterized the regression rate of its paraffin wax solid fuel. Read more about TM-1B [here](/TM-1B.md).
