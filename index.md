## Projects

#### High-Power Experimental Rocketry

Development of a high-power hybrid rocket started in June 2018 with the sub-scale Test Motor 1A. TM-1A underwent 3 series of static fires June - November 2018. Data collected from these static fires informed the development a new iteration, Test Motor 1B, which featured a more optimized de Laval nozzle. TM-1B was completed in August 2019 and underwent 1 static fire series August - September 2019, which characterized the regression rate of its paraffin wax solid fuel grain. The technical specifications of TM-1B are available [here](TM-1B.md).
