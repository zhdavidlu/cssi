title: About the CSSI

Place holder text from old website: "The Canadian Student Space Initiative (CSSI) is a student-run, non-profit organization founded in the Summer of 2018 to engage students across Canada to participate in space exploration. Since founding, we have developed a small hybrid rocket motor that has produced just under 30N of thrust and over 110NÂ·s of impulse. This motor has undergone 3 test firing series investigating how different parameters (ex. % mass of carbon black opacifier added) affects its operation. 

Learning from the small hybrid motor, we are well on our way into the development of a high-powered rocket. This rocket will be powered by a large hybrid rocket motor capable of producing up to 1kN of thrust. 

We are also working on a series of educational videos explaining the basics of rocketry, as well as designing a guide with many activities that can be done in science clubs in schools and other organisations across Canada to learn about space exploration and rocketry."
